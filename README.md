# React Calculator Project

This is a project for building a calculator using React, ViteJS, TypeScript, and Jest. The calculator will support basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as advanced operations like power and square. Additionally, it will provide functionality to use parentheses for grouping expressions.

## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd react-calculator
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Development

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the application in development mode. You can access it at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

The calculator provides a user interface for performing arithmetic operations. It supports the following operations:

-   Addition: Use the `+` operator.
-   Subtraction: Use the `-` operator.
-   Multiplication: Use the `*` operator.
-   Division: Use the `/` operator.
-   Power: Use the `^` operator.
-   Square: Use the `âˆš` operator.
-   Parentheses: Use parentheses `(` and `)` to group expressions.

## Testing

This project utilizes Jest as the testing framework. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

Jest will execute all the test cases defined in the `src/__tests__` directory and display the results.

## Build

To build the project for production, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build artifacts will be generated in the `dist` directory.

## Deployment

To deploy the application, you can use any static hosting service of your choice. Simply upload the contents of the `dist` directory to your hosting provider.
