# React Calculator Project

This is a project for building a calculator using React, Vite, TypeScript, and Vitest. The calculator will support basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as advanced operations like exponentiation and logarithms.

## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GoTierGod/react-calculator.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd react-calculator
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Development

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the application in development mode. You can access it at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Testing

This project utilizes Vitest as the testing framework. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Build

To build the project for production, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build artifacts will be generated in the `dist` directory.

## Deployment

To deploy the application, you can use any static hosting service of your choice. Simply upload the contents of the `dist` directory to your hosting provider.

## Calculator Usage

The calculator provides a user-friendly interface for performing arithmetic operations. It supports the following operations:

-   **Result**: Use the `=` button to obtain the result of the current expression.
-   **Clean**: Use the `AC` button to clear the screen.
-   **Delete**: Use the button below `AC` to remove characters one by one.
-   **Last answer**: Utilize the `ans` button to reuse the previous answer.
-   **Positive/Negative**: Use the `+/-` button to toggle the sign of the last number.
-   **Decimal**: Use the `.` button to input a decimal point.
-   **Addition**: Use the `+` button for addition.
-   **Subtraction**: Use the `-` button for subtraction.
-   **Multiplication**: Use the `x` button for multiplication.
-   **Division**: Use the `÷` button for division.
-   **Percentage**: Use the `%` button to calculate percentages.
-   **Parentheses**: Use the `( )` button to group expressions within parentheses.
-   **Pi (π) Number**: Use the `π` button to input the value of pi.
-   **Euler (e) Number**: Use the `e` button to input the value of Euler's number.
-   **Modulus**: Use the `mod` button to calculate the remainder of division.
-   **Fast one between x**: Use the `¹/x` button to quickly calculate the reciprocal of a number.
-   **Exponentiation**: Use the `x^` operator for exponentiation.
-   **Square Root**: Use the `√x` operator to calculate the square root of a number.
-   **Fast Squared Exponentiation**: Use the `x²` button for quickly squaring a number.
-   **Exponentiation with Base 10**: Use the `10^` button for exponentiation with base 10.
-   **Logarithm with Base 10**: Use the `log` button to calculate the logarithm with base 10.
-   **Natural Logarithm**: Use the `ln` button to calculate the natural logarithm.
-   **Round**: Use the `rou` button to round a number.
-   **Scientific Notation**: Use the `exp` button to represent numbers in scientific notation.
